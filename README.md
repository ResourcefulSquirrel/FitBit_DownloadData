# FitBit_DownloadData

## Overview

The functions here were written to download data from FitBit servers using the FitBit API. I used [fitbitr](https://github.com/teramonagi/fitbitr) from [Nagi Teramo](https://github.com/teramonagi), and I have a "registered" FitBit App, which is necessary to get the "key" and "secret" for using Oauth2.0

## Installation

Uh, I don't know...Download the .R files and good luck?

## Note

This is my first time using an Rproject or attempting to load a semi-complex thing to GitHub. Helpful feedback is appreciated.
